# E-commerce by HTML,CSS,php and MySQL
We worked upon creating an E-commerce website which has products such as Laptops, Computers, Tablets, Smartphones, Ipads, 
Iphones, and Clothing which was further sorted on the basis of the Company.
The user or customer can Select the product on the basis of his choice and can add to the cart and after 
adding all the items or products neede by the computer, the customer can go to cart by clicking on the option 
“Go to Cart”(which directs the user) to the Cart.

After reaching to the cart,  the customer can update his items by removing or adding.
Now ,if the user is registered, he can directly enter his credentials and can purchase the items. 

But, if the customer is not registered, then the customer need to sign up first and then he need  
by entering his credentials such as Name, e-mail, password, photo, Mobile no., Customer city, Customer Country and address.

After making the account, the customer can pay the amount and then he might receive the order in 2-3 days on the 
basis of location of Customers.

Furthermore, I have added a section as ”My Account”, where the customer can either change password, update details, 
delete account or Logout. It is must that each customer should have a account on the website which is automatically 
stored in MySQL database.
The connection of front-end to the database is done in a very secure manner by the usage of ‘php’. 
Now ,as we know that if the products are purchased by the customers so the stock may decrease, 
so the admin (incharge of the warehouse), may add new items on the website with their ‘MRP’. 
The admin plays a crucial role and thus only a few members can add products and items in the website with 
proper authentication. There are other parameters like deleting items from the website which can be performed only by the admin.
The whole items and their details is secretly maintained in the MySQL database.
